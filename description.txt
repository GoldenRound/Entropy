Good lord, I've been a lazy slacker, this was slated for like, october or so, and it's here two months later, geez.
I lost all my progress on the mod except sprite work, losing all your code can be pretty de-motivating. I've come back with new inspiration to see this mod through to the end. This mod includes all balanced versions of the claymores. I also learned a lesson about backing up data, which is important.
So the mod offers right now 19 total weapons, I might add a few additional ones just to bolster the roster a little here in the next few days.
God I hope I'm not missing anything

Mod Version - 1.0.0, more updates in the coming weeks/days

_____________________________________________________________________
Additonal Information

The next few updates will include minor changes, while the more major ones will include armor and possibly enemies, gearing up to bosses

_____________________________________________________________________

The mod page will be up soon enough, next update
There will be a dedicated GitHub so I don't lose this data this time and so you can see what shoddy code I'm using
The mod is now open source so there will be literally no chance of me dropping the ball this time, I'm also including minor notes such as stuff I had to fix before releasing the version, as well as a mini mod guide for common errors I've stumbled across
I've stumbled across more errors this time remaking the mod, then last time. Some were tiny things like a spelling error, others were simply I used a number value when it was asking for a ID value (look in text files in mod, can be found when looking in code)
More balancing changes along the way, I just haven't had much time to play with everything. Here in the coming days, I'll more than likely remove most of my mod list and do a normal playthrough and see how the stuff balance

Spriting Help

I suck at spriting so feel free to upload resprites when I make the mod home page, especially for the Hellstone Claymore, as I'm extremly unhappy with that one.
